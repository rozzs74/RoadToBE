Objectives
To have a solid foundation about HTTP cookie. What is the use case and 
when to use technique


HTTP Cookie - small piece of data that server sendt to client. Then 
user agent could store the value or can be send it back to the server.
The advantage of using HTTP cookie is to make the application optimise and performant.
Example under session management the server send cookie to client remembering it's credentials,
since server understand that transaction is using a cookie, it doesn't perform computation.
In summary it minimze the work load

Use case:
1.) Session management - Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember.
2.) Personalization - User preferences, themes, and other settings
3.) Tracking - Recording and analyzing user behavior


Creating cookies (Set-Cookie, Cookie)
    On receiving HTTP request, the server can send Set-Cookie header.
        1.) Session cookies - when client shutdowns the cookie is deleted. Below example doesn't have expiration date. Closing browser is not exception
            (HTTP Response) Set-Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco
            (HTTP Response) Set-Cookie: tasty_cookie=strawberry
            Every (HTTP Request)  Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry
        2.) Permanent cookies - Adding expiration make the cookie permanent with a specific date.
             (HTTP Response) Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT;
        3.) Secure and HTTP only cookies -  A secure cookie is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol.
            Note do not include sensitive information because it's not guaranteed to be safe and protected. Client can't be involved this feature to mitigat XSS.
            (HTTP Response) Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly
