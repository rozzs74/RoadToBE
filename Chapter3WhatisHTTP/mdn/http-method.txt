Objectives
To have a solid foundation about HTTP methods. What is the use case and 
when to use technique


HTTP methods (HTTP verbs) - it defines set of request methods or desired action to be performed by the client or give resource.

Desired actions ca be 
1.) Safe - Doesn't update the server state. Meaning a read-only operation. Example is GET, HEAD, OPTIONS. In addition safe methods are idempotent(Any operation equal to itself or same output)
	An unsafe methods are PUT, DELETE, POST (Idempotent).
	GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
	POST /pageX.html HTTP/1.1 (Unsafe) 
	DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1 (Unsafe)
2.) Idempotent - Multiple request would only give equal or same output with no side effects. Example GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE
	GET /pageX HTTP/1.1   
	GET /pageX HTTP/1.1   
	GET /pageX HTTP/1.1   
	GET /pageX HTTP/1.1   

3.) Cacheable - HTTP response that can be cached like, stored to be retrieved for later usage. Status code that are cacheable
	200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, and 501.
	Note: Adding Cache-Control header would prevent the caching.
	GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
	(…) 

	200 OK
	(…)
	GET /pageX.html HTTP/1.1
	(…)
	200 OK
	Cache-Control: no-cache
	(…)

Types of request methods:
1.) GET - Client request data.
2.) HEAD - Identical to GET but without response body that client won't used.
3.) POST - Client submitting entity causing a change state of server.
4.) PUT - Client replace or update current server reprensentation
5.) DELETE - Client delete specified resource
6.) CONNECT - Client create tunnel connection with server by specified resource.
7.) TRACE - Create loop back test along with path or target resource
8.) PATCH - Client applied partial modification to specified resource.
