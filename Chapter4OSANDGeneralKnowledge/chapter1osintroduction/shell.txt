Objectives: To have solid understanding of terminal usage using Linux shell command line.


Why use the command line?
	- It's been said that “graphical user interfaces make
		easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible” and this is
		still very true today.

What is the shell ?
	- When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell.
	- The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry
		out.
	- bash “Bourne Again SHell”, enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
		Steve Bourne.

Commmands
	Useful:
		$ - Current working directory
			username@machinename e.g: royce@royce-pc$:
		# - Super user privileges, meaning logged in as root user or admin.
		cal - display month calendar
		df - display current amount of space disk drives
		free - display amount of free memory
		exit - end terminal
		clear - clear command
		printenv | less - Prints all variable of the machine
	Navigation:
		pwd  - print working directory
		cd - change directory
			cd -
		ls - list content of directory 
			- ls -lahF
			- ls ~ /usr
	Exploring the system:
		file - Determine file type 
		less - View text files, by examine the content.
			- Can be binary content but the system will ask you to open.
	Manipulating:
		cp - copy files and directories
		mv  - move and rename files and directories
		rm - remove files and directories
		lb - create hard and symbolic links
		mkdir - create directories
		ln - create symbolic link

	Working with own commands
		type - Indicate how a command name is interpreted
		which - Display which executable program will be executed
		help - Get help for shell bins
			help cd 
			mkdir --help
		man - Display a command's manual page
		apropos -  Display a list of appropriate commands
		info - Display command info 
		whatis - Display one-line manual page desc
		alias - Create an alias for command

	Redirection 
		- I/O redirection or redirect - by means we can input / output commands to and from other files , 
		or multiple commands.
		cat - Concatenate files 
		sort - Sort lines of text
		uniq - Report or omit repeated lines
		grep - Print lines matching with a pattern
		wc - Print newline, word and byte counts for each file
		head - Output first part of the file
		tail - Output last part of file
		tee - Read from standard input and write to standard output files
		> (Overwrite)- Redirect and overwritten can be file name or path. Create files or folder
		>> - Redirect Posix systems but not overwritten instead append new item from the existing file.
			Redirect STDERR
				ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt
				ls -l /bin/usr 2> ls-error.txt (Redirect using stderr w/ file descriptor "2")
				ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt 2>&1 (Redirect using stderr and stdout w/ file descriptor "1" and "2")
				ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt 
				ls -l /bin/usr 2> /dev/null (Disposing unwanted output aka silence is golde)
				/dev/null - Is a system device or bitbucket which accept input and does nothing.
			Redirect STDIN
				cat ls-output.txt // Assume the text file is exsiting
				cat movie.mpeg.0* > movie.mpeg
					- An example of wildcard matching for multiple files with same name.
				cat
					- When you enter a cat with no argument it will function as read line input	
						as this command is categorized at STDIN typing argument which is 
						a keyboard already an INPUT would only display the output as STDOUT.
				cat >> lazy_dog.txt
					- Means redirect STDIN to a file and append content.
				cat < lazy_dog.txt
					- Change the source to a command from the file lazy_dog.txt
			Pipelines ( | ) 
				- Commmands capability to read data as stdinput and send data to stdoutput.
				in short a pipeline is a handy tool and technique to examine the output.
				- Often used for to perform complex operations on data.
				- Possible to put multiple commands chained by the pipeline symbol

				- Syntax: <command> | <command>
					Example
						ls -l /usr/bin | less 
						ls | less
						ls -lahFt | less >> lazy_dog.txt 
							- Combo for Navigation, Exploring and redirect 
						Pro tip: 
						Dont run ls > less inside /usr/bin.
			Filters (uniq, sort, wc)
				- Similar to pipeline but the output of the data is being filetered after running 
					multiple commands
				- sort command is an stdinput which sort the stdout
				Example
					ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | less
					ls | sort
					sort a,b,c,d
				- uniq command is to remove duplication of data before doing stdout
					ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | less
					sort | uniq

				- wc or stands for word count, this command is for displaying number of lines, words or even
					bytes under file.
					wc royce.text
					ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | wc -l
				- grep is a powerful program used to match text patterns within files.
					when pattern matched from grep it will print out to the line.
				 	Example: grep pattern [file....]
					ls /bin /usr/bin | sort | uniq | grep ssh
				- head and tail commands are for including first ten or last ten of the line
					it can be adjusted using -n 
					Example:
						ls | head -n 5
						head -n 5 royce.txt
						tail -n 5 ls-output.txt
						ls | tail -n 5
						For real time include option -f 
				- tee is a useful reads std input and stdout to a file
					Example: 
						ls /usr/bin | tee ls.txt | grep zip
						What it does, copied all content then save to a file exclude a file with a "zip" word.

	Expansion (technique) which is the most useful content.
		- For this we will just expand the value coming out from the command. A good example is echo
			echo $PATH
			echo 
			echo hello world
			echo "hello world"
		- Path name expansions are technique that utilise wildcards on a given path.
			echo * 
			echo D*
			echo [[:lower:]]*
			echo [[:upper:]]*
			echo .*
			echo .[!.]*
		- Tilde (~) - When this symbol is used in the beginning of a word,
				it expands "Home directory of the user".
			Example:
			echo ~
			echo $HOME
			ls ~ > ls2.txt
			echo ~ > ls3.txt
			If home directory has royce run this 
				echo ~royce
		- Arithmetic - allowing arithmetic operaion
			$((expression))
			+,-,/,*,%,**
				echo $((2+2))
				echo $(((5**2) * 3))
		- Brace - strangest expansion by creating multiple strings from the pattern 
				containing the braces.
				echo Front-{A,B,C}-Back
				ecyo royce{1,2,3} --> royce1 royce2 royce3
				echo royce{1..3} --> royce1 royce2 royce3
				echo {0..10} --> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
				echo {A..Z} --> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
				echo {Z..A} --> Output is the reverse of alphabetical letters
				A nested brace expansion - echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b --> aA1b aA2b aB3b aB4b
				mkdir {0..1}
		- Parameter - Introduces $
			- Store small chunks of data and give it a name or simple called a variable
				echo $USER --> me
				printenv | less
				a=100
				echo $a --> 100
		- Command substitution - allowing to output the command as an expansion
			echo $(ls)
		 	ls -l $(which cp) -->  -rwxr-xr-x 1 royce 197121 101764 Oct  5  2017 /usr/bin/cp*
			file $(ls -d /usr/bin/* | grep zip)
			- backqoutes - is the substitution for command under old bash version
				ls -l `which cp` -->  -rwxr-xr-x 1 royce 197121 101764 Oct  5  2017 /usr/bin/cp*
		- Qoutes 
			 echo this is a test --> this is a test
			 echo The total is $100.00 --> The total is 00.00
			 echo "this is a test" --> this is a test
		- Escaping char
			 echo "Total is \$100" --> Total is $100
