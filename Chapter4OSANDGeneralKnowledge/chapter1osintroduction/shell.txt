Objectives: To have solid understanding of terminal usage using Linux shell command line.


Why use the command line?
	- It's been said that “graphical user interfaces make
		easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible” and this is
		still very true today.

What is the shell ?
	- When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell.
	- The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry
		out.
	- bash “Bourne Again SHell”, enhanced replacement for sh, the original Unix shell program written by
		Steve Bourne.
