Attribute Values
    - An attribute holds a Values
    - The same attribute can be mapped to different values  (Same attribute mapped to different values)
        example
            a) height can be measured in "feet" or "meters".
    - Different attributes can be mapped to the same set of values (Same values mapped to different attributes)
        example
            a) Attribute values for ID and age are integers.

Attribute Classification
    - Discrete attributes
        a) Finite (limited size) or countably infinite set of values
        b) Often represented as integer variables or characters
            example:
                - integers
                - zip codes, click counts, set of words, collection of documents, gender
                - binary attributes such (1, 0) are special case of discrete values. It can be YES or NO, DEAD or ALIVE, 
                    one and zero
        c) For visualization discrete attributes, mostly frequently histograms (graph with a bar) are used. Because they represent relative frequencies of attribute values.
                thus, histogram is actually a probability distribution of attribute values.
    - Continuous attributes
        a) Has real numbers are attribute of value, such no limitation on the value itself. Theoretically can hold different value at all.
        b) Typically represented as floaing-point variables (decimals).
        c) Come from infinite set
            example:
                - temperature
                - height
                - weight
