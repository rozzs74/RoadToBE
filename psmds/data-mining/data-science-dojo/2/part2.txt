Attribute Values
    - An attribute holds a Values
    - The same attribute can be mapped to different values  (Same attribute mapped to different values)
        example
            a) height can be measured in "feet" or "meters".
    - Different attributes can be mapped to the same set of values (Same values mapped to different attributes)
        example
            a) Attribute values for ID and age are integers.

Attribute Classification
    - Discrete attributes
        a) Finite (limited size) or countably infinite set of values
        b) Often represented as integer variables or characters
            example:
                - integers
                - zip codes, click counts, set of words, collection of documents, gender
                - binary attributes such (1, 0) are special case of discrete values. It can be YES or NO, DEAD or ALIVE, 
                    one and zero
        c) For visualization discrete attributes, mostly frequently histograms (graph with a bar) are used. Because they represent relative frequencies of attribute values.
                thus, histogram is actually a probability distribution of attribute values.
        d) Discrete variables can take on either a finite number of values, or an infinite, but countable number of values. 
            The number of patients that have a reduced tumor size in response to a treatment is an example of a discrete random variable that can take on a finite number of values. 
            The number of car accidents at an intersection is an example of a discrete random variable that can take on a countable infinite number of values (there is no fixed upper limit to the count).
        e) To model your data use Binomial and Poisson
    - Continuous attributes
        a) Has real numbers are attribute of value, such no limitation on the value itself. Theoretically can hold different value at all.
        b) Typically represented as floaing-point variables (decimals).
        c) Come from infinite set
            example:
                - temperature
                - height
                - weight
        d) Continuous variables can take on infinitely many values, such as blood pressure or body temperature. Even though the actual measurements might be rounded to the nearest whole number, in theory, there is some exact body temperature going out many decimal places That is what makes variables such as blood pressure and body temperature continuous. 
        e) To model your data use Gaussian and Lognormal.
    - Test your understanding of Discrete vs Continuous
        Number of emergency room patients - Discrete
        Blood pressure of a patient - Continuous
        Weight of a patient - Continuous
        Pulse for a patient - Discrete
        Emergency room wait time rounded to the nearest minute - Discrete
        Tumor size - Continuous
