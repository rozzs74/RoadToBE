Attribute Classification
Important of attribute classes
	- Categorical Attributes (Descrite attributes) 
		- means finite state of values typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. 
		- An attribute where the values correspond to discrete categories. For example, state is a categorical attribute with discrete values (CA, NY, MA, etc.). Categorical attributes are either non-ordered (nominal) like state, gender, etc., or ordered (ordinal) such as high, medium, or low temperatures.
		- Feature engineering on categorical data
		- Bar plot and pie chart is used to visualize categorical data.
		- Types of categorical attributes:
			1) Nominal - A nominal scale describes a variable with categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. with numbers if you want, but the order is arbitrary and any calculations, such as computing a mean, median, or standard deviation, would be meaningless.
				- Examples
					ID numbers, eye color, zip codes, movie, music, video games genres, country names, weather, geno type, blood type
			2) Ordinal - ordered,An ordinal scale is one where the order matters but not the difference between values 
				- Examples
					Rankings, place in competition, grades, clothing sizes(XL, L, M, S XS), shoe sizes, education level, employment roles, socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), satisfaction rating (“extremely dislike”, “dislike”, “neutral”, “like”, “extremely like”).
			3) Interval - is a constant value with different values
				- Examples
					temperatures in Celius or Fahrenheit
			4) Ratio - A ratio variable, has all the properties of an interval variable, and also has a clear definition of 0.0. When the variable equals 0.0, there is none of that variable.
				     - When working with ratio variables , the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation
				- Examples
					Temperature in kelvin, length, time, counts, enzyme activity, dose amount, reaction rate, flow rate, concentration, pulse, weight, length, temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean “no heat”), survival time.
					 For example, because weight is a ratio variable, a weight of 4 grams is twice as heavy as a weight of 2 grams. 
		- In the 1940s, Stanley Smith Stevens introduced four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These are still widely used today as a way to describe the characteristics of a variable. Knowing the scale of measurement for a variable is an important aspect in choosing the right statistical analysis.
