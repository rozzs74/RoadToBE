Data Quality
	- very important when it comes to decision is having a data quality. By asking where the 
		problem is coming from.
	- most commonly looked by data scientist 
	- Three fundamental questions in data quality
		1) What problems should we worry about?
		2) How can we detect problems with the data?
		3) What can we do about these problems?
	- Examples of data quality problems (that shows up in production all the time):
		- Noise and outliers
		- Missing values 
		- Duplicate data
Noise
	- An invalid signal overlapping valid data
	- Data has inaccurate values
	- Examples
		1) Distortion of a person's voice over the phone.
		2) Snow on a television screen
		3) Human inconsistency in labeling, example is in sport judging the performance
	- invalid data pointes that obscuring the signals
	- determing the attributes which are noisy

Outliers
	- Data objects with characteristics that are considerably different than most 
		of the other data objects in data sets.
	- is data point that differs significantly from other observations.
	- the data is valid values and properly collected and clean but "ITS outside of the normal range"

Missing Values 
	- Reasons for missing values 
		1) Information is not collected 
			- (e.g., people decline to give their age and weight)
		2) Attributes may not applicable to all cases
			- (e.g., annual income is not applicable to children)
	- Handling missing values 
		1) Eliminate Data Objects
		2) Estimate Missing Values
		3) Ignore the missing values during analysis
		4) Replcate with all possible values (weighted by their probabilities)
Duplicate Data 
	- Data set may include data objects that are duplicates, or almost duplicates
		of one another 
	- Major issue when merging data from heterogeneous sources
	- Example
		Same person with multiple email addresses
