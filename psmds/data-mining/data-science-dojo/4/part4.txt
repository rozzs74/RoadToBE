Types of Data sets or Data sets classification
    - data sets are required in data analysis
	- Three different kinds of data sets 
		1) Record data 
			- that consists of a collection of records, each of which consists
					of a "fixed set of attributes".
			- consist of categorigal attributes like 
				a) Ordinal
				b) Nominal
				c) Continuous attributes
				- Data matrix 
					- data objects with only numeric attributes can be represented by an 
						m by n matrix, where there are m rows, one for each object 
						and n columns, one for each attributes
					- the data objets can be thought of as points in a multi-dimensional space,
						where each dimension represents a distinct attribute.
				- Document Data
					- each document becomes a "term" vector
					- each term is a component (attribute) of the vector
					- the value of each component is the number (discrete attribute) of times
						the corresponding term occurs in the document.
					- word processing?
				- Transaction Data
					- a special type of record data where each record (transaction) involves a set of items
					- consider a grocery store. The set of products purchased by a customer 
						during one shopping trip constitutes a transaction while the individual products
						that were purchased are the items.
		2) Graph Data	
			- world wide web
			- molecular structures
			- example: Generic graph and HTML links
			- consists of vertices and nodes 
			- a web page is an example of graph data
		3) Ordered Data
			- Sequential data
			- Generic Sequence data
			- Genomic sequence data
			- Spatial-Temporal data 
				- Average monthly temperature of land and ocean
