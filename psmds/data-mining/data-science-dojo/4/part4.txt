Types of Data sets or Data sets classification
    - data sets are required in data analysis
	- Three different kinds of data sets 
		1) Record data 
			- Data matrix
			- Document Data
			- Transaction Data
			- that consists of a collection of records, each of which consists
				of a "fixed set of attributes".
			- consist of categorigal attributes like 
				a) Ordinal
				b) Nominal
				c) Continuous attributes
			- Data matrix 
				- data objects with only numeric attributes can be represented by an 
					m by n matrix, where there are m rows, one for each object 
					and n columns, one for each attributes
				- the data objets can be thought of as points in a multi-dimensional space,
					where each dimension represents a distinct attribute.
			- Document Data
				- each document becomes a "term" vector
				- each term is a component (attribute) of the vector
				- the value of each component is the number (discrete attribute) of times
					the corresponding term occurs in the document.
				- word processing?
			- Transaction Data
				 - a special type of record data where each record (transaction) involves a set of items
				 - consider a grocery store. The set of products purchased by a customer 
				 	during one shopping trip constitutes a transaction while the individual products
					 that were purchased are the items.
