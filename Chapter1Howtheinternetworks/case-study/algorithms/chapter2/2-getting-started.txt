Insertion sort
	- solves sorting problem
	- With the ff
		1) Input: sequence of n numbers (a1,a2...an)
		2) Output: permutation ordering of the input sequence such that a1 <= a2 <= ..... <= an
	- the numbers we wish to sort is called keys
	- pseudocode employs expressive method clear and cocise to specify a given algorithm. The cleares method here is
		english
	- this type of sort usually a hand of playing cards.
	- this type of algorithm is efficient when sorting small numbers of elements
	- actual inputs for the insertion algorithm is containing the sequence of numbers and its length.
		[A.......1] A.length
	- What it really does?
		a) sorts input numbers in place.
		b) rearranges the numbers within array
		c) most constant numbers are stored outside array any time
		d) the input array contains the sorted output sequence when the insertion-sort produce finished	
    - Three categories for loop variations when working insertion sort
        a) Initialization
        b)
