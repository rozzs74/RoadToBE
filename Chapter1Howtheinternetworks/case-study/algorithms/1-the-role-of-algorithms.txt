algorithm 
 - takes input to process an output
 - sequence of computational steps that tarnsform input to output
 - is tool for solving computational-problems
 - instance is called as an input and should consider the constrains imposed in the problem statement which neede to solve the computational-problem.
 - an algorithm is CORRECT if input compute correct output.
 - the actual requirement in algorithm is the procedure that computational problem followed.
 - sample problems that algorithm can solve
    1.) Human Genome Project
         - without algorithm this project cannot identify 100,000 genes in human DNA, a 3 billion chemical base.
         - The savings are in time, both human and machine, and in money, as more informa- tion can be extracted from laboratory techniques.
    2.) Internet
        - without algorithms people today cannot retrieve huge amounts of information.
        - routes 
    3) Electronic commerce
        - without algorithms we cannot change goods electronically depending if private or public holding data. The core techologie is public-key
            cryptography and digital signatures are based in numerical algorithms and number theory.

    4) Manufacturing and other commercial enterprices
        - without algorithms oil, politician voites, air flights, isp speed are nothing. With the help of linear programming we solve the problem.
 - have many candidate solutions. it can be none or finding the best.

data structure 
    - a way to store and organize data to accept access and modification. Important to strengthen the limitations.

technique
    - many techniques available to solve the computational-problem

hard problem
    - speed is important in regards to algorithm, that is the only way if the algorithm efficient. like how long an algorithm takes procedure its result.
    - a NP-problem is solve by approximation algorithm
    - Example problem is travelling salesman problem
