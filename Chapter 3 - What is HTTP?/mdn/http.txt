HTTP 
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    - Port 80
    - an Application layer protocol that transmits hypermedia(sound, video) documents 
        such HTML.
    - Designed for communication between web browser and web server. Can be used to other purposes.
    - It follows client-server model.
    - Stateless protocol because server connection doesn't keep keep state between requests.
    - Request from web server is being initiate by the recipient which is the web browser.
    - HTTP processed the ff:
        1. Scrtips (JS, CSS)
        2. Mark up (HTML)
        3. Images (img)
        4. Video
    - Clients and servers communicate by exchanging messages. For the web browser it's called REQUEST message whilst server an
        answer of RESPONSE.
    - Designed 1990, being sent under TCP/IP layer or over TLS an encrypted TCP connection.
    - A client-server protocol, because the request is sent by single entity. It can be user-agent (or a proxy behalf of it.)  Or a web browser.
        Or can be a robot that crawls the Web to populate (Cypress, Selenium).
