Objectives
 To have a solid understanding and grasp knowledge about HTTP cache. What is the usecase and 
 when to use this technique.


 How cache is related to the web?
  - Modern web application improved perfomance by reusing the previous fetched resources rather than it process the request.
    So by means latency is reduce and network traffic which lessen the time to display the response. 

Caching
  - It's an optimazation technique that allows to store copy of items on given resource when the operation is repeated.

Web cache 
  - When a web cache is configured, the request will be intercept instead return the copy of request to avoid reprocess or redownload the request 
     from the originating server.

Advantage on web cache
 1. Booting server and computational mechanism is not happened in the origin web server.
 2. Improved perfomance as being closer to reach the client on the request.
 3. Less time transport the request back.

Disadvantage
 1. Consume time for proper configuration as resources aren't identical to each other.
 2. Only cache common things until it changes not longer relevant. Reprocess to other clients that uses it.

 Two category of web cache
 1. Private cache - only for single user 
 2. Shared cache - only for multiple users
